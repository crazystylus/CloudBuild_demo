# Cloud Build
This is a series of demos on Cloud Build to demonstrate how flexible and pluggable Cloud Build is.
## Part 1 - Getting Started
This demo showcases deploying a simple CI/CD pipeline on Cloud Build which builds a Go Web App and pushes the container image to Google Container Registry, then deploys to cloud run. You can either test the code as below for sanity check or directly deploy the pipeline and then test the CI/CD Pipeline itself. Cloud Source Repo is utilized for creating repo because it's a part of GCP offering making things more secure, but GitHub is also supported by Cloud Build.

## Part 2 - Caching Container Layers in Cloud Build
INPROGRESS

## Others
